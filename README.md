Project Overview: Design a system that uses sensor data to predict failures in industrial equipment, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Data Collection & Analysis:

Live Parameters:

  Real-time vibration and temperature readings from machinery e.g. pumps, motors etc.

  Instantaneous load or pressure measurements e.g. valves, pipes etc.

Long-Term Parameters:

  Trend analysis of sensor readings over weeks

  Cumulative usage hours and historical maintenance logs

  Predictive models that correlate gradual shifts in parameters with potential faults
  
Additional Details: 
Simulate or deploy physical sensors, stream data to a cloud database, and apply machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Short-term alerts can be generated if live readings exceed thresholds, while long-term analysis refines maintenance schedules.
